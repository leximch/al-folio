    <p>Reproductive activism has typically focused on abortion and pregnancy over other concerns, thereby centering white cisgender women and (increasingly) transgender men. Even trans-inclusive discourse has paid relatively little attention to the reproductive needs and possibilities of transgender women, particularly trans women of color. Accordingly, this paper analyzes how medicalized discourses, unequal access to healthcare, and cissexism intersect to discursively, medically, and legally deny motherhood to transgender women. Furthermore, it envisions contested futures where biotechnologies and reproductive trans bodies trouble "the coherence of a narrative that is already fragile" while potentially perpetuating existing inequities (Strangio 2015, p. 235).</p>

    <p>Assistive reproductive technologies create new modes and opportunities for family creation and family planning, but uneven access to these technologies magnifies existing inequities. Similarly, genetic engineering, prenatal screenings, and selective abortions introduce new dangers for marginalized people (e.g. the deaf community), who risk being ’engineered’ out of existence. I argue that these technologies expand the "mechanisms through which basic biological features of the human species became the object of a political strategy" [Michel Foucault, Security, Territory, Population: Lectures at the College de France, 1977-1978 (New York: Picador, 2009), 16.]. Further, I explore the regulatory role of biotechnology in the contested future of propagation, and how this is complicated by capitalism, heteropatriarchy, and white supremacy. This paper contributes to a broader conceptualization of who reproduces, how they reproduce, and what is ultimately reproduced.</p>

    <p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a popular tabletop roleplaying game, a genre in which players engage in logical, shared, structured fantasy predicated on certain fictional assumptions (Fine, 2002, p. 12). Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a collaborative and highly social activity, therefore requiring significant social investment and engagement by each member of the community (Adams, 2013, p. 77). Adams (2013) furthermore concluded that the game served as a “vehicle for players to consistently make an effort to socialize in structured ways” (p. 77). However, these communities continue to be associated with social ineptitude and further stigmatized by association with psychiatric disorders (Lis, Chiniara, Biskin &amp; Montoro, 2015, p. 381-382).

  I was introduced to a Dungeons &amp; Dragons community by a mutual friend. After an initial observation of several hours, I conducted preliminary interviews with both leaders (Dungeon Masters), in succession. Afterwards, I conducted a follow-up interview with just one of the leaders. This paper demonstrates the relationship between shared fantasy and collaborative consensus building, but pays particular attention to the unique jargon and conversational style of the community. I construct several taxonomies through thematic analysis, exploring the strategies gamers use to construct shared fantasy, and a shared repertoire based on cross- media references, politics, and the history of the game. This paper furthermore analyzes the role of report-talk, a typically masculine conversational style that uses the exchange of information as a means by which to compete for and communicate status (Tannen 1991). I explore how these values and styles serve to alienate women and impede female participation.</p>
