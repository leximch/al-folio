Hi! I'm an M.A. student in the Department of Anthropology at Georgia State University.

My thesis investigates medicalized frameworks of trans womanhood in the West, traced from the 19th century to the present. It envisions these frameworks as rationale for enhanced biopolitical control, aimed at reproducing dominant state ideologies, including capitalism, cisheteronormativity, and white supremacy.

Other research interests more broadly include:
- Artificial Intelligence & Society
- Biopolitics
- Health & Power
<!-- - Gender & Class -->
- Motherhood
- Technoethics
- Transmisogyny

<!-- I'm also a developer with experience in a wide range of technologies, including:
- Ruby
- Python
- Java
- HTML/CSS
- React -->

Also, I take photos occasionally. [Check them out](https://instagram.com/alxndramc).
