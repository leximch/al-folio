Hi! I am primarily a linguist and cultural anthropologist, but my work extends into visual culture and literary criticism as well. 

My thesis draws from affect theory, feminist psychoanalysis, and trans feminisms in an account of the social and psychological constructions of gender violence in media and film.

Research interests more broadly include:
- Affect Theory & Self
- Biopolitics
- Medicine & Power
- Psychoanalysis
<!-- - Gender & Class -->
- Queer Theory & Transfeminisms
- Gender, Horror, and Science Fiction

<!-- I'm also a developer with experience in a wide range of technologies, including:
- Ruby
- Python
- Java
- HTML/CSS
- React -->
