Hi! I'm an M.A. student in the Department of Anthropology at Georgia State University.

My thesis draws from discourse analysis, psychoanalytics, and trans/lesbian feminisms to investigate psychosocial constructions of the gendered self, and how these developmental constructs provide the schemata for gender-based violence and stigma. 

Other research interests more broadly include:
- Affect & Self
- Biopolitics
- Health & Power
- Psychoanalytics
<!-- - Gender & Class -->
- Reproductive Ethics
- Technoethics

<!-- I'm also a developer with experience in a wide range of technologies, including:
- Ruby
- Python
- Java
- HTML/CSS
- React -->

Also, I take photos occasionally. [Check them out](https://instagram.com/alxndramc).
