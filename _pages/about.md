Hi! I'm an M.A. student in the Department of Anthropology at Georgia State University.

My thesis draws from film studies, psychoanalysis, queer theory, and trans/lesbian feminisms to investigate gender violence through film representation of gender and gender variance.

Other research interests more broadly include:
- Affect Theory & Self
- Biopolitics
- Medicine & Power
- Psychoanalysis
<!-- - Gender & Class -->
- Queer Theory & Transfeminisms
- Gender, Horror, and Science Fiction

<!-- I'm also a developer with experience in a wide range of technologies, including:
- Ruby
- Python
- Java
- HTML/CSS
- React -->

Also, I take photos occasionally. [Check them out](https://instagram.com/alxndramc).
