Hi! I am an interdisciplinary anthropologist and gender studies scholar with a background in linguistics, sociology, software development, and literature.

I am currently working on my M.A. thesis, which draws from affect theory, psychoanalysis, and queer theory in accounting for the social and psychological construction of gender violence in film and media.

My research interests more broadly include:
- Affect Theory
- Digital Humanities
- Film Narrative
- Gender & Medicalization
- Psychoanalysis
- Queer Theory & Transfeminism

<!-- I'm also a developer with experience in a wide range of technologies, including:
- Ruby
- Python
- Java
- HTML/CSS
- React -->
