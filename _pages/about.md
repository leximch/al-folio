Hi! I'm an M.A. student in the Department of Anthropology at Georgia State University.

My thesis research draws from affect theory, feminist psychoanalysis, and trans feminism in an account of the social and psychological construction of gender violence through representation in horror films.

Other research interests more broadly include:
- Affect Theory & Self
- Biopolitics
- Medicine & Power
- Psychoanalysis
<!-- - Gender & Class -->
- Queer Theory & Transfeminisms
- Gender, Horror, and Science Fiction

<!-- I'm also a developer with experience in a wide range of technologies, including:
- Ruby
- Python
- Java
- HTML/CSS
- React -->

Also, I take photos occasionally. [Check them out](https://instagram.com/alxndramc).
